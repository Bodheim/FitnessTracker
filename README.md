## Description

I created a workout tracker for my dog. I was provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. I created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts for my dog. As we know with covid, my pupy gets more workouts than me. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
